  ![Albert Farrales]()

  I was just curious during Coronavirus and decided to see how much it 
  would cost to make a static website. So far I've paid 9 dollars for 
  my domain name, albertfarrales.com. The hosting is completely free 
  courtesy of Netfliy. (Not Sponsored)

  The HTML, CSS and JavaScript in this template are extremely minimal, 
  which makes the code easy to build on top of or replace completely.

  Make sure to drink enough water and take care.
