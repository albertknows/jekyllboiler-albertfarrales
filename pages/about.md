  My name is Albert Farrales and I'm currently 19 years old. 
  I'm currently a senior at the University of California, Santa Cruz
  majoring in Technology and Information Management. After college 
  I plan to move to Seattle and hopefully start a career in IT. 
  So far I have an internship as an Account Manager at OMT Enterprises 
  Inc. and am attending classes online concurrently at Foothill College 
  and UCSC.
