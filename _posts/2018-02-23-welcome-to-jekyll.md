I was truly inspired by my man `Creed Bratton` and his world famous blog, Creed Thoughts. Just kidding. To be honest, I'm not sure what to use this blog for. I think I find it's my way of documenting to the world besides having social media such as Twitter or Instagram. I hope to use this blog as some sort of archive for the special times of my life.
