Very interested quesiton. Especially in 2020... the word blog just seems so dated.

I blog to take my mind off the results of this CSE capstone 40-page paper. I blog to save the paper that otherwise would be wasted as a result of writing with a pen. 

I blog to blog I'm soooooooooooooooooooooooo tired.

Bye,

Albert Farrales
