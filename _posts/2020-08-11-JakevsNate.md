Let me start off by saying I'm not a professional but have done significant research on both fighters prior to the present-day.

Unless Nate Robinson has been cross-training as a boxer while in the NBA his whole life I think he has a slim to no chance at winning. Jake Paul has been training in boxing for around 3 years with the likes of Sugar Shane Mosley. Although he has fought no professional atheletes it is safe to say that his boxing fundamentals and IQ is there.

Nate Robinson has had around 2 months to train for the fight leading up to 11/30/2020. Yes, I know what you may be thinking... He's a freak athelete who had football/basketball scholarships straight out of college, x3 NBA Slam Dunk Champ, and former Knick/Celtic role-player, but it's hard to justify someone with little training and sparring beating someone with enough experience as Jake Paul.

Don't just take my word on it, here's Faze Sensei's (trained and experience boxing professional) take on the fight: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHZW2SAuV0.

TLDR why you bet on Jake Paul:

1. Height Advantage of Jake Paul (6'1 compared to Nate Robinson - 5'9)

2. Experience and Training (Nate Robinson has had 2 Months to train compared to Jake Pauls 2 Years)

Current Positions: 

$750 on Jake Paul (-170 Favorite). Lose 750 / Win 441.18.
